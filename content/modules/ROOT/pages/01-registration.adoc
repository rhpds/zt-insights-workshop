= Red Hat Insights Registration

== Registration

Let's connect the system to Red Hat Insights with the rhc command.

[source,bash,run]
----
rhc connect --organization 12451665 --activation-key 12-5-22-instruqt
----

.rhc connect output

From the above output, you can observe that the system has been
successfully registered with Red Hat Insights. As part of the
registration, the machine also uploads a report to Red Hat Insights so
that it may be analyzed for any issues.

For future reference, make note of your system hostname.

[source,bash,run]
----
hostname
----

NOTE: Your hostname will be different than the one listed in the output above.

At any time in the future, you can get information about Insights registration by using the `+--status+` option to `+rhc+`.

[source,bash,run]

Next, lets ensure that your system can run remediation playbooks from Red Hat Insights.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y rhc-worker-playbook
----
